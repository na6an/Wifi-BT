# Wifi-BT Firmware Development
### Firmware development using PSoC Creator IDE and WICED Studio

## Background
It's not easy to learn industrial grade firmware development unless you're already in the industry after getting CS/EE degree at a college. There are countless number of arduino/raspberry pi DIY hobby projects out there can be found on the internet, but majority of them stay merely at a hobby level.  

As an engineer with degree in unrelated major and a career field changer, I have been searching for an easy and affordable way to learn firmware. Eventually, I found out there are a few training resources available from some of embedded board manufacturers. Cypress semiconductor (http://www.cypress.com/) was one of them. There are training resources from bigger companies like NXP or Texas Instruments as well, but I ended up choosing Cypress because its training materials were more step-by-step style and beginner friendly.

Out of various types of firmware products, I wanted to start with firmware for wifi/bluetooth because it's one of the most basic technology we use everyday.

## Hardware Kit
There are various dev kits made by Cypress. Cypress dev kits have product code starting with "CY8CKIT."  
~~The kit I selected was PSoCÂ® 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT). I'm not 100% sure how they name the product number, but it appears the middle number is its PSoC version number as PSoC 6 is their latest product. The first Cypress training material I found was actually using PSoC only for bluetooth (CY8CKIT-062-BLE), but I thought it'd be better to leave an option open for wifi as well.  

I happen to have an error that preventing programming the tutorial firmware to the device, which bricked the device.  
Contacted Cypress regarding the issue but no luck finding the solution, still have no clue what might have caused the issue.    
Ended up return the Wifi-BT kit and bought the original BLE kit instead.
